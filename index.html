            <h2>Questions & Answers :</h2>

                <h5>How does Javascript work?</h5>
                    <p>JavaScript is a web-based scripting language. Translated language, 
                       which means that unlike C or C ++, it does not require a moderator
                       to translate its code. JavaScript is a scripting language that works
                       in a web browser. To create web applications or web pages, JavaScript
                       is used in conjunction with HTML and CSS. Many modern web browsers,
                        such as Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge, Opera, and 
                        others, support JavaScript. JavaScript is currently supported by most
                       Android and iPhone browsers. A web browser loads a page, scans HTML,
                        and generates a Document Object Model (DOM) from the content.
                        DOM provides your JavaScript code for a live web page view. 
                        The browser will then capture any HTML or CSS related images or files.
                        CSS Editor provides CSS information. HTML and CSS are compiled by DOM
                        to create a web page first. Then, the JavaScript browser engine uploads
                        JavaScript files and queue code but does not use the code immediately.
                        Waiting for HTML and CSS to complete the upload. Once this is done, 
                        JavaScript is applied in the form of code. This results in the DOM 
                        being updated with JavaScript code and rendered into the browser.
                       Order here is important. If JavaScript did not expect HTML and CSS 
                        to complete, it would not be able to change DOM features.

                <h5>what is difference between local storage and session storage?</h5>
                <p>The web storage API's localStorage and sessionStorage objects are two 
                    excellent tools for preserving key/value pairs locally. Cookies can be
                    replaced by localStorage and sessionStorage for storage.LocalStorage is
                    a feature that allows JavaScript sites and applications to store key pairs
                    in a web browser without having to worry about expiring them. This means
                    that the data stored in the browser will be saved when the browser window closes.
                    Session itemStorage only used to store one-time data. When the browser is closed,
                    data stored in sessionSorage will be deleted. A page session lasts as long as the
                    web browser is still active and maintained even if the page is updated. 
                    <br>
                    The expiration date is the only significant distinction between 
                    localStorage and sessionStorage.
                </p>
                <p>The store is persistent across browser sessions with localStorage. 
                   The storage is saved even if the domain is accessed in a new tab or the 
                   browser is closed and reopened. There is no time limit. <br>
                   When the page session expires, sessionStorage is cleared. The duration of a 
                   page session is determined by the length of time the tab or browser is open. 
                   As a result, every time you open a new tab or window, a new session and storage
                   are created.
